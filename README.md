# AD7142_Arduino
.h and .cpp files to communicate with the AD7142-1 capacitance-to-digital converter chip over IÂ²C using an Arduino.
All register addresses have been defined, as well as most relevant settings for these registers. 
Functions to control all these different registers are lacking, though I have no immediate purpose for adding these.
As such, this repo contains good starting files for your AD7142 project, but you may require to add additional functionality for your application.
